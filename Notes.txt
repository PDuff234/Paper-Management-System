Things that I need to add later
Validation messages for paper submission
Checks in the database so that a Reviewer cant be assigned more than 3 papers
Something in the Author Page that shows if that author has submitted a paper or not already
Have it to where each author can only submit one paper to the database (Probably another database check)
Link the scoring to each paper
Have the author define what genres the paper is 
Have the reviewer define what genres he is proficient in
Give the admin the ability to choose what papers he would like to assign to each reviewer
Once a reviewer submits his review for a paper, make the button (i.e. Paper 1 Button) null and inaccessible for the reviewer
